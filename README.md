Perl CPAN style module to simplify integration with [Xero API Applications](https://developer.xero.com)

Inspired by the Xero endorsed Ruby API Library [Xeroizer] 
and the CPAN [Net::Xero](http://search.cpan.org/~elliott/Net-Xero/lib/Net/Xero.pm) module, this Perl module aims to simplify integration with Xero API Applications
points for Public, Private and in the future Partner application services.
WebService::Xero modules primarily encapsulate the [OAuth (v1.0a) access control protocol as described by Cubrid](http://www.cubrid.org/blog/dev-platform/dancing-with-oauth-understanding-how-authorization-works/) .


# Install from CPAN

This package is now available through [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~localshop/WebService-Xero/)

````sh

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install WebService::Xero'

````

## XML-SAX Dependency

Because of dependencies on native XML libraries by some of the modules dependencies you may need to install native expat / xml libraries.

On AWS Linux you may need to install perl-XML-SAX using the package manager ````sudo yum install perl-XML-SAX perl-XML-Parser````

For other platforms see the GitHub Wiki


# Building from Source

## Prerequisites 

* Perl
* build tools ( make etc )
* Xero API Application with credentials as descibed in the [Xero Developer Getting Started Guide](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/getting-started/getting-started-guide/)

````sh
sudo apt-get install perl build-essential ## eg debian package install
````



## Installing Manually


This Perl code is in the standard CPAN package format and can be installed through CPAN or downloaded and installed manually either from [GitHub](https://github.com/Combined-Computer-Professionals/WebService-Xero) or CPAN:

```sh
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
```

### Installing Step by Step

Download the latest stable source:

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Combined-Computer-Professionals/WebService-Xero
    cd WebService-Xero
```

Create the makefile

```sh
perl Makefile.PL
```
If given notice of missing dependency modules, these can be installed from CPAN. For example to install a missing Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA module:
```sh
    sudo perl -MCPAN -e "install Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA"
    ## or if you have cpanm installed
    cpanm --installdeps .
```

NB: Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA from CPAN requires SSL devel libraries which
    can be installed as follows:
```sh 
  apt-get install libssl-dev   ## for debian etc
  yum install openssl-devel    ## for RH,Centos, Ubuntu etc
```
Make,test and install the library
```sh
make
make test
make install
```

## Usage

An example of a basic agent accessing a private Xero Application.
````perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use WebService::Xero::Agent::PrivateApplication;
use Data::Dumper;

my $xero = WebService::Xero::Agent::PrivateApplication->new( CONSUMER_KEY    => 'YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY', 
                                                    CONSUMER_SECRET => 'YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET', 
                                                    PRIVATE_KEY      => '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----.....etc'
                                                          );
## AND THEN ACCESS THE XERO API POINTS

my $contact_struct = $xero->do_xero_api_call( 'https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Contacts' );
print Dumper $contact_struct; ## should contain an array of hashes containing contact data.
````

An example of a minimalistic Mojolicious framework Public Application implementation can be found at [github.com/pscott-au/mojolicious-xero-public-app-demo](https://github.com/pscott-au/mojolicious-xero-public-app-demo)

See perldoc for details
````sh
perldoc WebService::Xero
````

### Todos

 - Classes for all Xero Components ( Item, Contact, Invoice etc )
 - Working Public Application Example 
 - Partner Application Interface
